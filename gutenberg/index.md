# Gutenberg

To take advantage of JavaScript developer tools, make sure to set `SCRIPT_DEBUG` in `wp-config.php`.
```php
<?php
define('SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );
```

A lot of the Mangrove Gutenberg setup is not documented yet. It's still in development.
But it's also largely there and usable.
Look at the mangrove-gutenberg plugin on MGTemplate.

I've started with documenting the trickier parts of Gutenberg.
I recommend you read those in order:

1. [Attributes](/gutenberg/attributes)
1. [Inspector Controls](/gutenberg/inspector-controls)
1. [Media](/gutenberg/media)
