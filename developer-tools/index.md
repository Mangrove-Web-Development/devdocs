# Developer Tools
Install these tools before you get started.

## Docker
Docker is used for the local development environment.

Docker Desktop requires Mac OSX or Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education edition. Windows 10 Home edition is not compatible. Let your Mangrove contact know if you do not have a compatible operating system.

Docker has additional system requirements which can be seen [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## EditorConfig
To help keep consistent code formatting, we use EditorConfig. Please install the respective EditorConfig plugin for your text editor. See [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/).

## Git GUI
We highly recommend using a Git GUI client, as this makes it much easier to understand branching, merging, and the relationship between production and development environments. [Fork] is a good one, but feel free to pick your favorite. Your GUI software may or may not include Git itself, so you may need to [install that separately](https://git-scm.com/).

### Some recommended GUI tools:
* [Fork] (Mac/Windows)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Mac/Windows)
* [GitUp](https://gitup.co/) (Mac)
* [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) (Mac)
