Install these tools before you get started.

## EditorConfig
To help keep consistent code formatting, we use EditorConfig. Please install the respective EditorConfig plugin for your text editor. See [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/).

## Git GUI
We highly recommend using a Git GUI client, as this makes it much easier to understand branching, merging, and the relationship between production and development environments. [Fork] is a good one, but feel free to pick your favorite. Your GUI software may or may not include Git itself, so you may need to [install that separately](https://git-scm.com/).

### Some recommended GUI tools:
* [Fork] (Mac/Windows)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Mac/Windows)
* [GitUp](https://gitup.co/) (Mac)
* [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) (Mac)

## Docker
Docker is used for the local development environment. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## WIP
Should LastPass, and Slack be documented here?
