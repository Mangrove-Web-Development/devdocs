# Docker
Mangrove uses Docker for local development.

## Docker Hub
Custom Docker images are hosted publicly in the
[mangroveweb Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/mangroveweb).
To manage this organization,
contact Jonathan about setting up a Docker Hub user with membership to this organization.

Docker images are built from public repositories in the
[Mangrove-Web-Development GitHub team](https://github.com/Mangrove-Web-Development).
