# Docker
Mangrove uses Docker for local development.

## Docker Hub
Custom Docker images are hosted publicly in the
[mangroveweb Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/mangroveweb).
To manage this organization,
contact Jonathan about setting up a Docker Hub user with membership to this organization.

Docker images are built from public repositories in the
[Mangrove-Web-Development GitHub team](https://github.com/Mangrove-Web-Development).

## Update Docker Compose File
Some projects may still have `rubidot/wp-util` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
This should be updated to `mangroveweb/wp-util`.

## [WIP]
Sorry! There's not much information here yet.

Would like to add a section on terminology:

- service
- image
- container
- volume
