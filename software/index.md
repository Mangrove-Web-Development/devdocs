# Required Software
Install these tools before you get started.

## Docker
Docker is used for the local development environment.

Docker Desktop requires Mac OSX, Windows 10 or Linux.
Additional system requirements which can be seen [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).

Let your Mangrove contact know if you do not have a compatible operating system.

Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## EditorConfig
To help keep consistent code formatting, we use EditorConfig. Please install the respective EditorConfig plugin for your text editor. See [editorconfig.org](https://editorconfig.org/).

## Git
Install [git](https://git-scm.com/).
Do not install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)!
This is unnecessary and may cause confusion.

## Recommended Software

### Git GUI
We highly recommend using a Git GUI client, as this makes it much easier to understand branching, merging, and the relationship between production and development environments. [Fork] is a good one, but feel free to pick your favorite.

#### Some recommended GUI tools:
* [Fork] (Mac/Windows)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (Mac/Windows)
* [GitUp](https://gitup.co/) (Mac)
* [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) (Mac)
