## SSH Public Key
Add your SSH public key, **not the private key**, to the [SSH Keys document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18f2wRxvz3h4fRB6XDwiAOWtG9yAR9olstZruN3ppMRY), and let your Mangrove contact know it's there so they can [add it to WPEngine](wpe-add-git-key).

If you don't yet have a public key, see the documentation on [generating an SSH key](generate-ssh-key).

## Mangrove Accounts
You should have a `yourname@mangrove-web.com` GSuite (Gmail) account. With this, setup accounts on these services:
* LastPass - shared password management
* Asana - project management
* Harvest - time tracking/billing
* Slack - chat
* WPEngine - WordPress host
* Toybox - task management

## LastPass
We recommend you manage all your Mangrove passwords using LastPass. Create a "My Accounts" folder for your own logins.

You will be granted access to the `Shared-Mangrove Team Internal (Limited) - for new devs` shared folder.
