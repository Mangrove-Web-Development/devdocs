# Developer Documentation
Welcome to the Mangrove Web Development Developer Documentation.

You should have a Mangrove admin or developer buddy to support you with setting up and make sure you have access to everything you need to get started.
If you don't know who that is, contact [support@mangrove-web.com](mailto:support@mangrove-web.com).

This documentation is a work in progress. Incomplete portions and notes about the progress of this document will be marked with [WIP].

If you're getting setup for the first time, we recommend you start in this order:
